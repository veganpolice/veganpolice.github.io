## FAQ

**Do we need to bring in water?**
- There is a nearby creek which we drink from. Bring extra though as well!

**Is this illegal?**
- No. If we stay under 100 people we are allowed to have an event on crown land, so long as we have certain documents and plans in place. Which we do! 

**What is the venue like?**
- The SKY venue (if whether looks good) is 15 minute drive North of whistler on the highway, then another 10min (7km) on a forest service road, suitable for pretty much any car, going slow (potholes).
- There is a large, mostly flat but slightly slanted gravel area that works well for dance floor, stage, generators, portapotties + room for many other things around the parameter. Behind the gravel, there is a grassy area good for camping. There are a few really nice tent spots, many OK tent spots. Last year we had many cars in the camping area.
- At the back of the grassy area is a short 2m path to the river / falls pictured above. If water level is low, a further 5min walk is required to reach the water. Water is alpine, though there is a small hydro project upstream - I drink it.

**Can I invite anyone?**
- We have a few spots left! Ask on slack if its more than 1 person. They should complete [the form](https://forms.gle/yAJraFUxsFuaFcQU8)

**What is the bear situation like around the site? Are we going to need to hike food/coolers back to our vehicles in between meals?**
- Storing food at night in your car is recommended but whats most important is that you do not keep food in your tent. 

**Can i bring my motor home, large vehicle or shitty car?**
- The road in is a graded forest service road with many potholes, but nothing requiring clearance. Any decent 2wd car can make it no problem. A very very weak car might struggle up one of the hills on loose gravel. A large motorhome would probably make it but would experience some bouncing along the way. There is room for such large vehicles though it may not be flat since the flat spots will be reserved for camping!

**Is there cell reception on site?**
- Not really. Spotty service seems to be able to send and receive SMS messages. If you drive back towards the highway five minutes you can get call and data service.

**Can I come just for the party and drive back to whistler or elsewhere instead of camping?**
- Driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol is not acceptable. We don't need any attention from the authorities so please plan to either camp or be sober.
