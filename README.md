## FAQ

**Can i bring my motor home, large vehicle or shitty car?**
- The road in is a graded forest service road with many potholes, but nothing requiring clearance. Any decent 2wd car can make it no problem. A very very weak car might struggle up one of the hills on loose gravel. A large motorhome would probably make it but would experience some bouncing along the way. There is room for such large vehicles though it may not be flat since the flat spots will be reserved for camping!

**Is there cell reception on site?**
- Not really. Spotty service seems to be able to send and receive SMS messages. If you drive back towards the highway five minutes you can get call and data service.

**Can I come just for the party and drive back to whistler or elsewhere instead of camping?**
- Driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol is not acceptable. We don't need any attention from the authorities so please plan to either camp or be sober.
